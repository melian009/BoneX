#23 Oct Discussion; Christian, Leo, Daniel, Carlos

Ponds -- depth obtained from sampled ponds

Markovian full vs sampled ponds - 
S_t+1 = D(LsxLs)_t x S_t

S_t+1 presence-absence vector in the ponds
D(LsxLs) sampled pond matrix

Satellite images
How much resolution are there?

Proposal MC
Cutoff to run only subsets - two ponds - Leo
Mainland-island approach targeting temporary pond with an environment surrounded by permanent
Many permanent-temporary pond-pairs to predict empirical patterns in temporary ponds
