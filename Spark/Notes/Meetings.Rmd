## Project Overview

Boolean networks as a way of modeling ecosystems services

## Meeting 05/08/2025
Alvaro, Bruno, Carlos, Paulinha at EAWAG

Brainstorming ideas and some key points that were made:

* Usually in Boolean networks there is no population dynamics associated and it would be a great contribution to integrate these two
* Even more if we integrated Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) with Boolean Networks in a community ecology context. In SHS some populations are so rare that their dynamics could be considered stochastic, whereas other populations would follow classic deterministic dynamics

* What Bruno has started involves understanding how costs and benefits of interactions influence the persistence of species within a networks. For that he uses the structure of empirical mutualistic networks and associated costs and benefits for each species. When benefits surpass costs, species are "on" and present on the networks, as the cost of interaction increases, once it surpasses the benefits, species get extinct from the network. He found a sharp transition where above a certain cost, most species go extinct. Costs and benefits are randomly sampled from a distribution. Next steps to explore include:
  + What are the analytical expectation for the boundary conditions (having all species present when $benefits > costs$ and all species extinct when $benefits < costs$ considering normally distributed costs and benefit functions)$
  + Expectations for random networks, what are the final number of interactions when network is random and cost benefit functions are also random
  + Starting from a random network, what kind of cost and benefit functions would result in networks that resemble the structure of empirical networks? Perhaps here we need to explore different distributions (beyond uniform or normal, for example, beta or lognormal) to give rise to networks with asymmetries like we observe in empirical networks (nestedness patterns for example, which are a common structure found in mutualistic systems)
  + Connection of boolean networks, costs and benefits and game theory -- what is the threshold for a Nash equilibrium considering costs and benefits in mutualisms? Is it possible to find an equilibrium even when the cost of the interaction is not zero?
  + Asymmetries in the costs benefit functions (shifting the curves to understand when the system collapses)
  
* How environmental fluctuations influences the predictability of ecosystem services
  + Fluctuations from the topics to the pole
  + $O_2$ as a global service $vs$ pollination as a local service

* Discussion of the probability of all species being present (or extinct) given the distribution of costs and benefits following a normal distribution with means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ and standard deviations $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. The derivation is on the Notes folder
    + Next step: understand the shape of the decay -- does it follow the same pattern observed for ecological networks?
    
* **Environmental function** Within the cost function, there is a physiological cost, which can be associated with an increase in cost given a deviation from an environmental optimum $\theta$. This would become: $\alpha = | \theta - z_i|$, where $z_i$ is the optimum for species $i$ and $\theta$ can be either sampled or alternatively it can include environmental fluctuations (akin to the proposal and published paper by Carlos and Paulo). The added environmental fluctuation could be of the form $\theta = \frac{A}{2} \left( 1 + \sin(2 \pi \omega t\right)$

* **Specialization function** considering that benefits cannot accumulate indefinitely, we can incorporate a saturation function into the benefit function. With this we can explore the trade-off between number of partners and costs and benefits of interactions. 
  + Consider bottom-up assembly building networks? For now we are considering a "top-down" approach in which the interaction network is given (might be the simplest to keep this and incorporate the saturation when parameterizing the cost-benefit functions).
  The form of this function is:
$$
S = \frac{\left( \sum_j^k A_{ij} B_j \right) B_{max}}{\beta + \sum_j^k A_{ij} B_j}
$$
  
  
* Connection between network structure and ecosystem services: how are the collapse of networks related to the loss of ecosystem services? Services are lost before the network collapses but what are the "early signs" that can signal such a shift? If we find literature exploring this aspect we can use it to parameterize the ecosystem service in a Boolean way. For example, imagine that one of these signals is the change in one of the properties of the network, as long as that property holds (degree of nestedness, for example), the service is "on", after a certain threshold, even if you have species and interactions the service is no longer available. In one extreme you can imagine that a single species performs the service. In that case, losing that species would lead to the loss of the service as well. Here we can explore how far a network can be "perturbed" (loss of interaction due to increase in cost) until the service is lost, based on information on properties of the network.
