To set the costs and benefits parameters we chosed a **beta distribution**. This distribution was chosed for some reasons:

  - The values are all positive. As do not exist negative cost or negative benefit, it fit to our data;
  - The values are defined on the inverval [0,1]. It could be used as the percentage of costs and benefits;
  - As the values are bounded between 0 and 1, we know the maximum value of benefits for one species, that is $B \le k_{i}$, where *k* is the degree of *i*;
  - The shape of the curve assume diffent forms as a function of the paramters. In nature we really do not know the shape of the distribuitions of costs and benefits;
  - It have a solution for ou case, which the other option of distribution (lognormal) do not.
