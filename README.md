* Ecological networks as boolean networks in dynamic landscapes

*** Boolean binary networks represent species states, presence/absence, making interactions-connectivity time-dependent. We explore the dynamics of time-dependent on-off interactions on the dynamics of ecological networks. A second stage includes the on-off environmental state as a function of dynamic landscapes, i.e., a periodic function determines the probability and strength of the interaction if the environment is on, otherwise the interaction can not be realized ***
